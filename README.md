# energy_landscape_analysis
Here we provide codes and exaxmple usages for energy landscape analysis of multivariate time series data such as fMRI data.

There are the following two folders in this repository.

Conventional: To carry out energy landscape analysis using the pairwise entropy model (i.e., Ising model) inferred by the conventional gradient-ascent algorithm.
Variational_Bayes: To carry out energy landscape analysis using variational Bayes approximation method.
