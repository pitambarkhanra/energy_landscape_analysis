# Energy landscape analysis with the conventional likelihood maximization and variational Bayes approximation methods

We provide codes and example usages for energy landscape analysis of multivariate time series data such as fMRI data.

There are the following two folders in this repository.

**Conventional**: To carry out energy landscape analysis using the pairwise maximum entropy model (i.e., Boltzmann machine, inverse Ising model) inferred by the conventional gradient-ascent algorithm.

**Permutation_test**: To carry out permutation test and find the p-values using the pairwise maximum entropy model inferred by the conventional gradient-ascent algorithm.

**Variational_Bayes**: To carry out energy landscape analysis using the variational Bayes approximation method.
